    "### Double Q-Learning Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional Q-learning, a single Q-function is used to estimate the value of state-action pairs, which can often lead to overestimation bias during training. Double Q-learning addresses this by maintaining two separate Q-networks - $ Q_{\\phi_1}(s), Q_{\\phi_2}(s) $ - to estimate Q-values more accurately. The key idea is that, instead of relying on a single network to both select and evaluate actions, we alternate between the two networks. At each time step, one network selects the action, and the other evaluates its value, reducing overestimation bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further enhance stability, we also utilize two target networks - $ Q_{\\phi_1^{\\prime}}(s), Q_{\\phi_2^{\\prime}}(s) $ - to generate stable target values for updates. The target value is computed by taking the minimum of the two Q-value estimates from the target networks, as follows:\n",
